Filling the cavernous hangar is the drone field, an inseparable mass of flying, walking and rolling robots, slaved to the factory's central schematic.

The ecological forming we're doing on Pandora only differs from that in scale. Here, local species are eliminated and the Formers saturate the land with Earth-native minerals (nitrates, phosphates and so on). Then the Formers distribute genetically- and cybernetically-modified Earth plants and pollinating insects that can survive long enough to alter the environment towards the desired norm. "/>
